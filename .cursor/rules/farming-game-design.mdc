# Farming Game Design Guide

## Core Concept
This is **Harvest Tactics** - a turn-based grid-based farming puzzle game for the Devs That Jam 36-hour challenge. The complete design specification is in [DESIGN.md](mdc:DESIGN.md).

## Key Design Principles
- **Minimal code, maximum depth**: Simple mechanics that create strategic gameplay
- **36-hour timeline**: Prioritize core gameplay over complex features
- **Browser-first**: HTML5/Canvas for easy itch.io deployment
- **Polish focus**: Last 8 hours dedicated to juice and game feel

## Development Priority Order
1. **Phase 1 (Hours 1-8)**: Core prototype - grid, placement, basic crops, turns
2. **Phase 2 (Hours 9-16)**: Full gameplay - all crops, synergies, complete UI
3. **Phase 3 (Hours 17-24)**: Polish - art, audio, bug fixes, submission prep

## Core Mechanics to Implement
- 8x8 farm grid with tile placement
- 5 crop types with different sizes and growth patterns
- Turn-based progression system
- Scoring with crop synergies
- Strategic resource management

## Success Criteria
- Fun, replayable gameplay loop
- Clear farming theme throughout
- Intuitive mechanics requiring no explanation
- Smooth browser performance
- Complete, polished submission

Always refer to [DESIGN.md](mdc:DESIGN.md) for detailed implementation checklists and specific requirements.
