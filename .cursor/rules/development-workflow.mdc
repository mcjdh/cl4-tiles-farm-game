# Development Workflow Guide

## 36-Hour Timeline Management
Track progress using the checkboxes in [DESIGN.md](mdc:DESIGN.md) to ensure we stay on schedule.

## Phase 1: Core Prototype (Hours 1-8)
**Goal**: Playable MVP with basic mechanics
- Focus on core game loop first
- No art polish yet - use simple shapes/colors
- Test placement and turn mechanics immediately
- **Milestone**: Can place crops, advance turns, see basic scoring

## Phase 2: Full Gameplay (Hours 9-16)
**Goal**: Complete feature set
- Add all 5 crop types with different behaviors
- Implement synergy scoring system
- Build complete UI with all game states
- **Milestone**: Full game from start to game over

## Phase 3: Polish & Submit (Hours 17-24)
**Goal**: Polished, submittable game
- Art pass and visual consistency
- Audio implementation and juice effects
- Bug fixes and edge case handling
- **Milestone**: Ready for itch.io submission

## Development Priorities
1. **Core mechanics first**: Grid → placement → turns → scoring
2. **One feature at a time**: Complete each system before moving on
3. **Test frequently**: Playtest after every major addition
4. **No premature optimization**: Get it working, then make it pretty

## Quality Gates
- **Hour 8**: Must have playable core loop
- **Hour 16**: Must have complete gameplay
- **Hour 20**: Must have all content implemented
- **Hour 24**: Must be submission-ready

## When Things Go Wrong
- **Behind schedule**: Cut advanced features, focus on core
- **Bugs blocking progress**: Implement workarounds, note for later
- **Feature creep**: Always refer back to [DESIGN.md](mdc:DESIGN.md) priorities

## Daily Workflow
1. Check current phase in [DESIGN.md](mdc:DESIGN.md)
2. Pick next unchecked item in priority order
3. Implement feature completely
4. Test immediately
5. Check off completed item
6. Repeat

Stay focused, test often, and keep the farming theme central!
